# Decision-Tree-Implementation

Reconstructed the Decision Tree Classifier with an accuracy of 94%. 

Provided a categorical dataset, it can predict a class for any given input. If the dataset is continuous the values will be grouped into a class. 

A Tree is created while training, which has all the paths as, all the possible combinations of the categories, and the leaf stores the majority class output for that one path.

The technical aspects which are used in this project are -  Tree Data Structure, OOPs in Python, Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, IPython, pydotplus Libraries

The Tree Data Structure has been visualized with the help of IPython Library.

The handing of the Dataset has been done with help of Pandas and Numpy.
